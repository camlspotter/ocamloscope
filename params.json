Currently available at http://ocamloscope.herokuapp.com/\r\n\r\n## Technology\r\n\r\n* Edit distance based search\r\n* On memory DB for speed\r\n* OCamlFind/OPAM friendly\r\n* No compiled source of packages is required at server side\r\n* Eliom based server http://ocsigen.org/eliom/\r\n\r\n## Problems?\r\n\r\nOCaml◉Scope is still under development. There are tons of to-dos and issues. Please report at https://github.com/camlspotter/ocamloscope/issues\r\n\r\n## FAQ\r\n\r\n### What is {blahblah} in results?\r\nThis is OCamlFind package name. Module names are prefixed by their package names to distinguish modules with the same name but in different packages.\r\n\r\n### Search result is not good.\r\nI know. I am sorry but currently I am working on the server scalability rather than search quality.\r\n\r\n### Why not by type unification?\r\nUnification is cool, but not suitable for API search. It is slow and often misses what the user actually wants to find.\r\n\r\n### My favorite package is not in the DB.\r\nIn future I release a tool to fetch search data from compiled and installed OPAM packages. You will be able to use it to pack the data and submit to OCaml◉Scope db repository. But not now.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
